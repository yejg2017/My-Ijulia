    "Plotting commands will send inputs through a series of preprocessing steps, in order to convert, simplify, and generalize. The idea is that end-users need incredible flexibility in what (and how) they are able to make calls. They may want total control over plot attributes, or none at all. There may be 8 attributes that are constant, but one that varies by data series. We need to be able to easily layer complex plots on top of each other, and easily define what they should look like. Input data might come in any form.\n",
